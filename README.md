# Backend Assessment

## Introduction

**Welcome to the Backend Assessment!**

This assessment is designed to help you practice the skills and knowledge you have acquired from the _WD-107 Backend course_. You will be building a `Node.js` `Express` `MongoDB` application to make API endpoints and combine data from the [Unsplash API](https://unsplash.com/documentation). You will create simple and complex `GET` routes, as well as full `CRUD` functionality for a `favoriteUsers` collection. You will also need to connect your app to a `MongoDB` database, and create a full login system with Authentication using `JWT`.

To complete this assessment, complete every task in **Parts I** through **VII** outlined below.

**Requirements to Pass**

- All routes must return the correct status code and data.
- Routes, controllers, models, middleware, etc. must be created in the appropriate files and folders.
- In `Part I` through `III`, `async/await` and `try/catch` blocks must be used to make requests and handle errors rather than promise chaining.
- Errors must be handled and returned to the user.
- The `db.js` file must be set up correctly.
- The `MongoDB` database must be set up correctly.
- The login system must be secured using `JWT`.
- Your code must be clean and readable. It should follow the DRY principle.
- Routes created in **Part VI** should be accessed only by users who are logged in.
- Error handling middleware is implemented for all `favorites` routes (created in **Part VI**).
- Auth middleware is implemented for all `favorites` routes (created in **Part VI**).

**Important Note(s)**

- Use [axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios) to make requests to the [Unsplash API](https://unsplash.com/documentation).
- Save all sensitive passwords and keys to an `.env` file.
- Upon completing this assessment, submit your Github repo link and the `.env` file.

**Commit to Github**

- [✔] Commit your work to Github and push to your forked repository w/ a commit message that reads, `"Part I - Setup"`.

### Part II - API GET Routes: Return Unsplash Photos

**Create the following `GET` routes in the `photoRoutes.js` file:**

- [✔] Use `/api/photos` as the base path for all photo routes

**`/api/photos` Route**

Create a `GET`route in the `photoRoutes.js` file that:

- [✔] Returns an array of **raw** **Unsplash** photo URLs.
- [✔] If the `catch` block is triggered, returns a `500` status and a JSON object with a `message` key assigned to a string that reads, `"Server error. Please try again later."`

**`/api/photos/:id` Route**

Create a `GET`route in the `photoRoutes.js` file that:

- [✔] Returns a single photo object from the Unsplash API based on a photo's `id`
- [✔] If the `catch` block is triggered, returns a `500` status and a JSON object with a `message` key assigned to a string that reads, `"Server error. Please try again later."`

**Commit to Github**

- [✔] Commit your work to Github and push to your forked repository w/ a commit message that reads, `"Part II - API GET Routes: Return Unsplash Photos"`.

### Part III - Advanced Route: Return Combined Data

**`/api/photos/user/:username` Route**

Create a `GET`route in the `photoRoutes.js` file that:

- [✔] Returns an array of a user's **Unsplash** photos based on a `username` parameter.
  - [✔] The array of photos should be an array of objects with the following keys:
    - [✔] `id` - photo's id
    - [✔] `username` - the `username` of the `user` who added the photo
    - [✔] `description` - photo's description
    - [✔] `url` - photo's raw URL
    - [✔] if the `description` is `null`, the `description` key should be assigned to a string that reads, `"No description provided."`
- [✔] If the `catch` block is triggered, it returns the error `status` and a JSON object with a `message` key assigned to the error message contained in the `axios` error response data. Use [Axios Response Schema documentation](https://axios-http.com/docs/res_schema) as needed.

**Commit to Github**

- [✔] Commit your work to Github and push to your forked repository w/ a commit message that reads, `"Part III - Advanced Routes: Return Combined Data"`.
